# Bonus Features

## Today button

- I implemented a Today button feature which let's the dispatcher view the current week tasks with ease no matter where they are in the Calendar view.

## Custom svg Calendar

- I have implemented custom svg gradients for tasks and built the Calendar component from scratch.

## Accessibility

- All background colours implemented meet WCAG minimum contrast ratio's for accessibility.

- Usage of Semantic elements over div's whenever possible.

## Deployment

- The app has been deployed using Netlify at [https://rose-rocket-code-challenge-summer-2020.netlify.app/](https://rose-rocket-code-challenge-summer-2020.netlify.app/)
